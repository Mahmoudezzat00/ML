# ML
using a  dataset and data from historical Olympic games, and try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.


# Machine learning project steps
Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here. This outline will help you tackle any machine learning problem.

Project Steps

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
(If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
3. Clean the data for ML.
4. Pick an error metric.
5. Split your data.
6. Train a model.


# Code
